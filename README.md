- 👋 Hi, I’m @Frantik85
- 👀 I’m interested in C/C++, Python, ML/ AI, Data science
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use the Mosquitto Lib to code a small project about logging temperature and humidity from several NodeMCUs and send them to a RaspPi in order to store this data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on no project yet - I don't feel ready for that ;)
- 📫 How to reach me ...
